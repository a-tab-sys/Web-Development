What is an HTTP Server?
An HTTP server is a software or hardware that processes HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests from clients (like web browsers) and sends back responses. It acts as a middleman between users and web applications.

In simple terms, an HTTP server:

Listens for incoming requests on a specific address (IP + port).
Processes the request (e.g., fetching a webpage, sending data).
Sends a response back to the client (e.g., an HTML page, JSON data, or plain text).

------------------------------------
An Example Node.js Application
The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:
const { createServer } = require('node:http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});

---------------------------------------
What Are We Creating With This Code?
With this Node.js code, we are creating a simple HTTP server that:

Listens on localhost (127.0.0.1) at port 3000.
Responds to any incoming request with:
Status 200 OK.
A "Hello World" text message.
Does not handle specific routes (e.g., /home or /about), just sends the same response to all requests.

---------------------------------------
How This Fits into Web Development
This is a basic server, but in a real-world application:

It could serve HTML pages, images, or JSON data.
It could handle user input and process forms.
It could interact with databases to retrieve and store data.
