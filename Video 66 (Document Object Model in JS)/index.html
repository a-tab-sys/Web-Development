DOM - document object model
    - the dom is the js object{} that represents the page you see in the web browser and provides you with an API to interact with it.
    - web browser constructs the DOM when it loads an html document, and structures all the eleemnts in a tree-like representation.
    - JS can acccess the DOM to dynamically change the content, structure and style of a web page


    - when we type something like document.
