# Web Development Repository

This repository documents my progress as I learn full-stack web development through a comprehensive course. It serves as a centralized location for all the concepts, projects, and notes I create as I advance through the curriculum.  

## Purpose  
The goal of this repository is to track my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. It includes resources, code, and projects across various technologies and tools essential for modern web development.  

## Current Progress  
I have currently completed approximately one-third of the course and have covered the following topics:  
- **HTML**: Basics of structuring web pages, semantic elements, forms, tables, and more.  
- **CSS**: Styling techniques, selectors, layouts (flexbox, grid), responsive design, animations, and more.
- **Figma**: Designing and prototyping user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: Programming fundamentals, DOM manipulation, ES6+ features, and more.  

As I progress further, this repository will include additional topics, such as:  
- **React**: Building dynamic and reusable components, hooks, and state management.  
- **Node.js**: Backend development with JavaScript.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing modern UIs.
- **Backend**

## Folder Structure  
The repository will be structured to reflect the various sections of the course:  
1. **HTML**: Code and notes related to HTML topics.  
2. **CSS**: Styling techniques and responsive design implementations.  
3. **JavaScript**: JavaScript basics and practical projects.  
4. **React** *(coming soon)*: React-based projects and components.  
5. **Backend** *(coming soon)*: Node.js and backend development concepts.  
6. **Other Tools** *(coming soon)*: Tailwind CSS, Figma designs, and more.
