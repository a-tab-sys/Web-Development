    <span>i an span and i am inline</span>

<!-- notice that the colors you added in css. the anchor tag only got color on the width it took up but the paragraph got color throughout the whole width 
 
WHY?
anchor tag is inline element - only take up as much width is nesessary
paragrpah is block element - take up full screen width

see that span and scnchor are on same line because theyre in line elements

How do we know what elements are block and what are in line - comes with prctise but we have a reference list
