Hey I am your first HTML file

Website works 3 ways
    Client - is me we ask the browser for things, like open youtube, or anything
            then it ses the server to open youtube for you
    Server
    Browser

Client (me) sends a request to server through the browser.
Brawser is like my assistant - it will do as i ask

If i asked browser to open youtube, the server managed by youtube has some code in it
This code is converted into the user interface we se on youtube by the browser

STEPS HOW WEBSITE WORKS
client requests the browser, the Browser (ex. google) requests the server
browser recieves server response (yes, no, error: not found)
then browser displays the code it recieves for client, but it displays the code as the ui we are used to

Backend
who generates the code that our browser recieves from out server? - the backend!
when we look at webpage code- we are only really seeing front end code, we will not be able to access backend code 

Frontend
made of html(the skeleton of the website), 
css(the design/syle of the website-color/icon/shape. like the beauty of cite), 
JS (when you searh and get autocoomlete - this is js. its client side scripting you can change stuff from the client side. like the brain of cite)
    (want to change page content without reload- thats js)

when you are for example ordering smth online, you are clicking and seecting color, item
the JS of that site is commnitaing with a the server and there the server is provideing
any approprita actions and sending over to client (you) without needing to reload the page because of JS - video 2 youll see that you ont need to reload

Car example - the skelaton(HTML)
            - the color, decoration, style (CSS)
            - engine, internal logic (JS)
