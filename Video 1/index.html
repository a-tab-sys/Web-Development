Hey I am your first HTML file

Website works 3 ways
    Client - is me we ask the browser for things, like open youtube, or anything
            then it ses the server to open youtube for you
    Server
    Browser

Client (me) sends a request to server through the browser.
Brawser is like my assistant - it will do as i ask

If i asked browser to open youtube, the server managed by youtube has some code in it
This code is converted into the user interface we se on youtube by the browser

STEPS HOW IT WORKS
client requests the browser, the Browser (ex. google) requests the server
browser recieves server response (yes, no, error: not found)
then browser displays the code it recieves for client, but it displays the code as the ui we are used to

Backend
who generates the code that our browser recieves from out server? - the backend!
when we look at webpage code- we are only really seeing front end code, we will not be able to access backend code 

Frontend
made of html(the skeleton of the website), 
css(the design/syle of the website-color/icon/shape. like the beauty of cite), 
JS (when you searh and get autocoomlete - this is js. its client side scripting you can change stuff from the client side. like the brain of cite)
    (want to change page content without reload- thats js)


Car example - the skelaton(HTML)
            - the color, decoration, style (CSS)
            - engine, internal logic (JS)

            
BTW you connected to git
locally you are master
origin is github repo
