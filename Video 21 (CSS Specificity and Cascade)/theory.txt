css has a cascade algorithm. this determines what properties are applied and what are not applied. 

cascade algorithm follows a couple rules- read here about cascade algorithm: https://www.codewithharry.com/tutorial/css-specificity/

So, the order of specificity is below, you sould change things from right to left because that way you can override things:

Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector

Specificity Calculation
To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector: THESE SHOULD BE USED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
Universal Selector: 0
Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
ID selectors: 100
Inline styles: 1000


AVOID INLINE STYLES because they are so hard to override
