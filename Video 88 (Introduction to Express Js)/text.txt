in your terminal have to add npm i express@4 to install express version 4. need to do this for every project folder



Why should we use express?
    - express js is a web framework, designed specifically to make websites. http package has limited capabilities: cant serve static files, security needs to be implemented from the start, for handling get and post requests you will have to write custon code.

Why do we use nodemon? 
    - nodemon restarts the server evertime we make changes so we don have o do manually in terminal with node <file name>


GO to express JS documentation to access starter code. https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html
Embedded below is essentially the simplest Express app you can create. It is a single file app: 

const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
